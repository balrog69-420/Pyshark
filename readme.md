# PCAP Analysis Tool

## Project Description
This Python-based tool analyzes PCAP (Packet Capture) files, providing insights into network traffic. It processes basic packet information, analyzes protocol distribution, and identifies top talkers in the network. The results are stored in a SQLite database for easy querying and visualization.

## Features
- Load and process PCAP files
- Extract basic packet information (source IP, destination IP, protocol, length, timestamp)
- Analyze protocol distribution
- Identify top talkers (most active IP addresses)
- Store results in a SQLite database
- Display results in a tabular format
